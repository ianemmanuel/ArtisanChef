/*
 * Claim/reassign/escalate workflow for compliance cases — deliberately
 * modeled as close as possible to VendorApplication's review workflow
 * (claimApplication/reassignApplication/escalateApplication in
 * admin.vendor.service.ts) so the two feel like siblings. Two deliberate
 * deviations, both from a 2026-08-26 refinement pass (see CLAUDE.md):
 *
 *  1. Claiming from the escalation pool requires the claimant be
 *     country-scoped to the vendor's own country — a globally-scoped
 *     holder of VENDORS_COMPLIANCE_RECEIVE_ESCALATION still cannot claim
 *     (see claimComplianceCase). Compliance follow-up stays with the
 *     local country team; the applications escalation pool has no such
 *     restriction.
 *  2. Manage actions (waive/notify/revoke, and reviewing a remediation
 *     document) require the actor to ALREADY be the claimed owner —
 *     unlike claim/escalate, there's no "unclaimed = anyone may act"
 *     fallback for these (see assertClaimedByActor). And once a case is
 *     claimed specifically out of the open escalation pool
 *     (claimedFromEscalation), that admin is the terminal resolver — they
 *     can no longer escalate it further, only reassignment (a
 *     supervisory override) can move it off their plate. A normal
 *     reassignment resets this, since reassignment is a deliberate
 *     hand-off, not the receiving admin opting into being the end of the
 *     line.
